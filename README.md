# Spring Boot Security & Observability Lab

This is an advanced, hands-on lab demonstrating the architectural evolution of a modern Java application. We will build
a system from the ground up, starting with a secure monolith and progressively refactoring it into a fully observable,
distributed system using cloud-native best practices.

## Workshop Guide: The Evolutionary Phases

This lab is structured in distinct, self-contained phases. The `main` branch always represents the latest completed
phase. To explore a previous phase's code and detailed documentation, use the links below.
