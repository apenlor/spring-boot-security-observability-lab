# Spring Boot Security & Observability Lab

This repository is an advanced, hands-on lab demonstrating the architectural evolution of a modern Java application. We will build a system from the ground up, starting with a secure monolith and progressively refactoring it into a fully observable, distributed system using cloud-native best practices.

## Workshop Guide: The Evolutionary Phases

This lab is structured in distinct, self-contained phases. The `main` branch always represents the latest completed phase. To explore a previous phase's code and detailed documentation, use the links below.

| Phase                                    | Description & Key Concepts                                                                                                                                                                                       | Code & Docs (at tag)                                                                                                                    | Key Pull Requests                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| **1. The Secure Monolith**               | A standalone service that issues and validates its own JWTs. Concepts: `AuthenticationManager`, custom `JwtAuthenticationFilter`, `jjwt` library, and a foundational CI pipeline.                                | [`v1.0-secure-monolith`](https://github.com/apenlor/spring-boot-security-observability-lab/blob/v1.0-secure-monolith/README.md)         | [#2](https://github.com/apenlor/spring-boot-security-observability-lab/pull/2), [#3](https://github.com/apenlor/spring-boot-security-observability-lab/pull/3), [#4](https://github.com/apenlor/spring-boot-security-observability-lab/pull/4) |
| **2. Observing the Monolith**            | The service is containerized and orchestrated via `docker-compose`. Concepts: Micrometer, Prometheus, Grafana, custom metrics, and automated dashboard provisioning.                                             | [`v2.0-observable-monolith`](https://github.com/apenlor/spring-boot-security-observability-lab/blob/v2.0-observable-monolith/README.md) | [#6](https://github.com/apenlor/spring-boot-security-observability-lab/pull/6)                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **3. Evolving to Federated Identity**    | The system is refactored into a multi-service architecture with an external IdP. Concepts: Keycloak, OIDC, OAuth2 Client (`web-client`) vs. Resource Server, Traefik reverse proxy, service-to-service security. | [`v3.0-federated-identity`](https://github.com/apenlor/spring-boot-security-observability-lab/blob/v3.0-federated-identity/README.md)   | [#8](https://github.com/apenlor/spring-boot-security-observability-lab/pull/8)                                                                                                                                                                 |
