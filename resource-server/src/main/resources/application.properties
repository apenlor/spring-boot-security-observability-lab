# SERVER CONFIGURATION
# ===================================================================
# Configures the main server port for the application business API.

# ===================================================================
# JWT SECURITY CONFIGURATION (SELF-CONTAINED TOKEN ISSUER)
# ===================================================================
# The secret key for signing and verifying JWTs using the HS256 algorithm.
# It MUST be at least 256 bits (32 bytes) long for security.
#
# --- Architectural Decision: ---
# For this phase of the lab, the secret is managed in this properties file for simplicity.
# In a production environment, this value MUST be externalized and managed by a secure
# secrets management system and injected as an environment variable.

# ===================================================================
# MANAGEMENT & ACTUATOR CONFIGURATION
# ===================================================================
# Run the management endpoints (actuator) on a separate, dedicated port.
# This is a critical security practice to isolate sensitive operational endpoints
# from the public-facing application API.
management.server.port=9092

# Explicitly expose the actuator endpoints required for observability.
# "prometheus" is for metrics scraping by machine.
# "metrics", "health", and "info" are for operational checks and debugging.
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=prometheus,metrics,health,info

# Enable the info contributor that reads "info.*" properties from the environment.
management.info.env.enabled=true

# ===================================================================
# APPLICATION METADATA (for info endpoint)
# ===================================================================
# These properties provide metadata about the application via the /actuator/info endpoint.
# The "@" symbols are automatically replaced by Maven during the build process via resource filtering.
